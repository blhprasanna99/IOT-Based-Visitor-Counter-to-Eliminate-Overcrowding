# IOT-Based-Visitor-Counter-to-Eliminate-Overcrowding

Overcrowding in malls, theatres and other public places jeopardizes publicÂ  health mainly
during the virus related pandemic situation like covid19. There is a need to restrict the number of
people that should be allowed into the premises. Hence, our project - IOT based visitor counter keeps
track of the visitors count and rings an alarm or buzzer. When anyone enters the room, the counter is
incremented by one and the total number of persons present in the room is displayed on OLED.
Visitor counting is a counter of the number of visitors entering and exiting in offices, malls, sports,
venues, rooms etc. Visitor counter helps to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of employees,
floor area and sales potential of an organization and ensures the eradication of overcrowding.
